# Machine Learning Project: Adaline, Perceptron, and Neural Network

## Overview

This project implements machine learning models, including Adaline, Perceptron, and a neural network, for binary classification tasks. The models are trained and evaluated on subsets of the Iris dataset and a custom dataset. Visualization of decision boundaries and performance metrics is included.

## Features

- **Adaline Algorithm**:
  - Implements a custom Adaline class.
  - Trains binary classifiers for different classes.
  - Visualizes decision boundaries after each epoch.
  
- **Perceptron Algorithm**:
  - Uses Scikit-learn's Perceptron implementation.
  - Plots decision boundaries for training and testing datasets.
  
- **Neural Network**:
  - Implements a simple feed-forward neural network with Keras.
  - Evaluates the XOR problem with a fully connected network.
  - Plots the training loss.

## Repository Contents

- **Training and Testing Plots**:
  - Adaline decision boundaries (`adaline_training_set_class_X.png`, `adaline_testing_set_class_X.png`).
  - Perceptron decision boundaries (`perceptron_training_set.png`, `perceptron_testing_set.png`).
  
- **Model Performance**:
  - Training loss visualization for the neural network (`model_loss.png`).

- **Main Notebook**:
  - Code for implementing, training, and visualizing models.
